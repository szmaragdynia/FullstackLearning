# Fullstack Open 
This repo contains all the excercises and everything else regarding my learning path, learning from the Fullstack Open, from the University of Helsinki.


## Info for reviewer(?):
On branch master is work for review - clean and nice.<br>
Another branches are for learning purposes so they might be messy :) (more comments, explanations, perhaps additional directories to check how stuff works or some edge cases etc.)
