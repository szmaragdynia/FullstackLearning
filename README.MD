Work for review is on main - it's clean.

I work on main-dirty. There is(might be) additional stuff for myself - more comments, explanations, perhaps additional directories with files for testing stuff etc. 

When I finish part0, I commit and push to main-dirty. I then stash, checkout to main, clean stuff up, and commit and push to main.
	I then checkout to main-dirty.



Then I finish part1. I commit and push to main-dirty. I then stash ONLY PART1 DIR???????

, checkout to main, clean stuff up, and commit and push to main.




pracuje na mainAllPartsDirty, zrobie np part 0, to  stashuje, checkoutuje, wywalam komentarzei sprzatam, i commit i push na mainAllPartsClean.
	potem wracam na AllpartsDirty, robie part1. Jak zrobie, to stashuje, checkoutuje, sprzatam, merguje z mainAllPartsClean.
